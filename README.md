# Airplanes and Wildlife Strikes Dashboard

#### Summary

This project visualises wildlife strike incidents involving aircraft in the U.S. between 2001 and 2015 using FAA data. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard to help users explore where and when strikes occur, which species were involved, and how severe the outcomes were. The dashboard uses consistent colour to highlight a specific airport and its associated incident data.

#### Tools & Skills Used:
- Tableau
- Dashboard design
- Data visualisation
- Colour encoding
- Data analysis

#### Key Insights:
- While most collisions resulted in wildlife loss, only 5.3% of collisions caused financial damage.
- The most costly collision occurred at LaGuardia Airport ($41 million) and was caused by geese during the climb stage of flight.
- Dallas Fort Worth Airport saw the most collisions (877), with perching birds being involved in the majority of collisions.

#### Data Source
